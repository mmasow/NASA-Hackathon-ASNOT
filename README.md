COMPAS ‚Äî Compliance Monitoring & Pollution Attribution System

Overview

COMPAS (Compliance Monitoring & Pollution Attribution System) is a secure, cloud-based platform designed to revolutionize environmental monitoring and enforcement across Africa and beyond. By integrating data from NASA‚Äôs TEMPO satellite, weather systems, and ground-based air quality sensors, COMPAS transforms complex datasets into real-time insights, predictive analytics, and actionable intelligence for environmental agencies.
The platform empowers organizations like SANEA (South Africa), NEMA (Kenya), and similar agencies across Africa to proactively detect, track, and enforce industrial emission standards ‚Äî ensuring cleaner air and healthier communities.
The Growing Problem of Air Pollution Choking the Air We Breathe
Air pollution is one of the world‚Äôs most pressing public health crises. It causes respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and premature deaths, disproportionately affecting vulnerable and low-income communities.

Problem Statement:

A high percentage of the global population inhales polluted air, with African nations bearing an unfair share of this burden. Governments are tasked with enforcing industrial emission standards ‚Äî yet enforcement remains weak due to outdated, legacy monitoring technologies that lack real-time granularity and precision. In the United States, the EPA oversees environmental protection. In South Africa, SANEA carries this responsibility and in Kenya, the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) fulfils this mandate. However, despite their efforts, the limitations of existing monitoring systems prevent these agencies from proactively enforcing standards and holding specific polluters accountable.

Case Study: The 'Deadly Air' Ruling ‚Äî South Africa, 2022

‚Ä¢	In 2022, South Africa‚Äôs ‚ÄòDeadly Air‚Äô court ruling became a landmark victory for environmental justice. The court affirmed citizens‚Äô constitutional right to a healthy environment, compelling government action to improve air quality in Mpumalanga Highveld, one of the most polluted regions in the world. This legal precedent now forces authorities to enforce stricter air quality standards and accelerate the transition away from coal dependency, where industrial emissions have caused widespread asthma, cancer, and respiratory disease.

‚Ä¢	Similarly, the 2023 wildfires in Canada and Europe revealed the global scale of air pollution ‚Äî demonstrating how inaccurate forecasting and poor transboundary monitoring can worsen public health and climate challenges.

The Proposed Solution: COMPAS

COMPAS is a secure, intelligent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that integrates multiple data sources into a unified system for monitoring, prediction, and enforcement.
Key Features
üåê Real-time Monitoring: Uses NASA TEMPO, weather APIs, and ground AQI sensors to track pollution dynamically.
ü§ñ AI & Machine Learning: Detects emission anomalies, predicts air quality trends, and attributes pollution sources.
üìä Interactive Dashboard: Provides visual analytics, forecasts, and data-driven insights for agency officials.
üß† Decision Support: Offers legally defensible evidence for policy enforcement and compliance verification.
üîî Automated Alerts: Notifies officials of high-risk emission zones or air quality violations.
‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Ensures scalability, data security, and seamless collaboration between agencies.

Making a Difference with NASA Technology

By integrating NASA‚Äôs TEMPO satellite data and advanced predictive models, COMPAS bridges the gap between science and enforcement. It enables governments to:
‚Ä¢	Precisely identify and attribute emission sources
‚Ä¢	Optimize resource allocation for inspections
‚Ä¢	Provide transparent public reporting, and
‚Ä¢	Strengthen accountability among industries.

Conclusion
The COMPAS platform represents a critical step forward in environmental governance. It combines space-based observation, machine learning, and regulatory analytics to give environmental agencies the power to act ‚Äî not react. By enabling precise detection of polluters, optimizing agency resources, and providing legally defensible evidence, COMPAS helps governments: Safeguard public health, ensure corporate accountability, and deliver measurable financial and environmental impact.
